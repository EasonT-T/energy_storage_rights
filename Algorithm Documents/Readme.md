## The basic calculation method is following the principles: 
#### For return of investment:
ROI = Net Profit / Total Investment * 100
#### For gross profit: 
Gross Profit =(( energy power * electricity price) - maintenance fee) * number of year

##### The installation cost is to calculate the installation fees for different technologies including solar & wind panels. Basically, most of the investment from users are put in the installation of technologies, thus the investment can be simplified to installation cost. 
Investment = installation cost
(Note: if possible, please take inspection fee and technology renew fee,the price of conducted material, labour cost in consideration)

##### In addition, the installation cost also need to be taken into consideration in order to calculate the net profit: 

Net profit = (annual profit - maintenance cost rate * area input) * number of year - installation cost * area input
Therefore, the return of investment can be calculated by:
ROI  = Net profit / (installation cost * area input) * 100

#### Detailed explanation of this algorithm is shown in the report of “Cost analysis of generating roi”  in Google drive.
