## Introduction
Deployment of renewable energy technologies in different location are often comes with advantage and disadvantage. The energy storage rights is a digital platform that will map, evaluate, promote and help investments in the development rights for energy storage pilot projects such as pumped hydro energy storage, floating solar pilots on lake or sea. Alongside with the platform is energy storage rights application.

We strike to built up an application which used to evaluate and optimize the performance and potential of location viable for development of different renewable-energy technologies, this outcome will then be visualized to the target user. 

## Vision
Our client, the team of Energy Storage Rights, wishes to develop a website application that can find the best location to get the richest energy source in order to maximize the profit margin. The target users include small enterprises, organizations, individuals. In summary, an applicable and portable website application which can evaluate and utilize the renewable energy for potential users is our clientâ€™s desired outcome at the end of the project.  

## Objectives
Objective 1: Understand the project and make the assumption
Objective 2: familiar with programming develop language and environment.
Objective 3: Identify data source and collect data from a variable source.
Objective 4: Create a Todo App (This is a requirement from client that does not relate to this project.
Objective 5: Deliver an MVP which includes deliverables <br/>
To be added, refer to gantt chart.


## Desired Features
###  Two primary functions
For our web application, we are planned to have two function to allow the users to identify the suitable area for renewable energy technologies development. 
For our first function, we need to calculate the return of investment by develop various kind of renewable technologies for the area selected by users. Then, we could use a similar algorithm to identify the top N locations that is suitable for development in a relative large area. To rank different locations, we will continue to use the return of investment as the parameter.

### Smart choices by system
Nearest energy grid<br />
Suitable locations for different technologies<br />
Best combination<br />
Analyze local developers<br />
### A user-friendly interface
Area cover<br />
Power output by month<br />
Total power output<br />
Total implementation cost<br />
Annual value<br />
Return of investment<br />
Shown data usage<br />

## Milestones

## The potential of the project
Many potential users are interested in renewable energy, our application can help to identify the high potential area for developing renewable energy. This allow to generate more interaction between the property owner and renewable energy developer. Land owner can be benefit from this application by making more effective and smart decision on the use of renewable energy product, it also help them to reduce the spending in energy, increase in efficiency in energy storage. For the renewable energy developer, it grants them more opportunity to delop their products. This application is expected to create a win-win situation between each parties.
