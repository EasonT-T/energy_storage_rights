## Introduction
Deployment of renewable energy technologies in different location are often comes with advantage and disadvantage. The energy storage rights is a digital platform that will map, evaluate, promote and help investments in the development rights for energy storage pilot projects such as pumped hydro energy storage, floating solar pilots on lake or sea. Alongside with the platform is energy storage rights app.

We strike to built up an application which used to evaluate and optimize the performance and potential of location viable for development of different renewable-energy technologies, this outcome will then be visualized to the target user. 

## Vision
Upon the successful completion of the project, this application should provide a web platform that allow the customers to find suitable locations and choose appropriate renewable energy technologies, thus, generate higher profit.

## Objectives
Objective 1: Understand the project and make assumption<br />
Objective 2: familiar with programming develop language and environment.<br />
Objective 3: Identify data source and collect data from variable source.

## The potential of the project
Many potential customers are interested in renewable energy, our application can help to identify the high potential area for developing renewable energy. This allow to generate more interaction between the property owner and renewable energy developer. Land owner can be benefit from this application by making more effective and smart decision on the use of renewable energy product, it also help them to reduce the spending in energy, increase in efficiency in energy storage. For the renewable energy developer, it grants them more opportunity to delop their products. This application is expected to create a win-win situation between each parties.
