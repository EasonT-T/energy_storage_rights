# Algorithms

The following algorithms are used to calculate the return of investment (ROI) of installing a certain renewable energy source in a given location.

## Simple Algorithms

### Base Algorithm 1

This algorithm is more or less independent to the technology used (solar, wind, hydro).

##### Step 1

Find all the costs, necessary for generating 1 kWh of electricity, paid by other developers around your desired location and average them.

##### Step 2

Find the distance to your consumer / to a grid node, and find the cost of building the infrastructure to transport that energy to your consumer (IE cost of power lines)

##### Step 3

Find the price of 1kWh of energy in the desired location.

##### Step 4

Multiply the result from Step 1 with the sumber of kWh you want to generate and add the result from Step 2. This will be your total development cost.
Divide this to the result from Step 3 and you'll get the number of hours needed to get back your invested money.

#### Data Needed

Costs of renewable energy plants, price of electricity and grid node locations around your geographical area.
